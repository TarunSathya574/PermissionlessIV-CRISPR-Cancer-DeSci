# 🧬 CRISPR-Cancer-DeSci: Democratizing Evidence based Cancer Research
Permissionless IV Hackathon - BNB DeSci Track

Making breakthrough cancer research accessible, verifiable, and collaborative through blockchain-powered CRISPR analysis.

Exploring glioblastoma tumor heterogeneity using AI-enhanced CRISPR data, advanced ML, and BNB Chain verification - built for researchers worldwide.

# 🎯 The Problem I am Solving
Cancer research is broken:

🔒 Siloed data: Critical research locked behind paywalls and institutional barriers
🤔 Reproducibility crisis: 70% of researchers can't reproduce published studies
🏛️ Centralized gatekeeping: Small group of institutions control access to breakthrough discoveries
📊 Opaque methodologies: Black-box analysis pipelines hide crucial research steps

Result: Life-saving cancer treatments delayed by years, costing millions of lives.
💡 Our Solution: Permissionless Cancer Discovery
CRISPR-Cancer-DeSci creates the world's first fully transparent, verifiable, and permissionless cancer research pipeline:
✅ Open Access: Anyone can analyze CRISPR essentiality data for glioblastoma
✅ AI-Enhanced: GPT-powered gene annotation reveals hidden therapeutic targets
✅ Blockchain Verified: Every result cryptographically proven on BNB Chain
✅ Reproducible: Complete audit trail from raw data to published findings

🏆 Hackathon Innovation Highlights
🚀 Track: BNB DeSci
💎 Key Innovation: First blockchain-verified CRISPR analysis pipeline
🎖️ Technical Breakthroughs:

Agentic AI annotation of cancer vulnerability genes
Advanced manifold learning (UMAP/PHATE) for tumor heterogeneity discovery
Merkle tree + ZKP proofs for tamper-evident research
